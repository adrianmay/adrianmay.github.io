<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Empirical Development is an evidence-based software development process.</p>
<p>The main points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The customer might be king, but don’t die for them.</li>
<li>Take control of the product roadmap.</li>
<li>Quote probabilities with all deadlines.</li>
<li>POs decide what, PMs predict when.</li>
<li>Testers are trainee POs.</li>
<li>Use data mining and simulation for estimation and planning.</li>
<li>Use the same data for detecting knowledge monopolies.</li>
<li>Don’t sprint cos it distorts, blurs and oversimplifies everything.</li>
<li>Control tech debt by not rushing the devs.</li>
<li>Involve devs in designing solutions.</li>
<li>Specify a range of luxury to allow scope trimming under pressure.</li>
<li>Minimise churn using employee engagement.</li>
<li>Foster controversy, as it’s the mother of invention.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="reality"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Reality</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="customer-relationships"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Customer relationships</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.1.1" id="types"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>(Time and materials out of scope.)</li>
<li>Might just be willing to do scrum, esp. small, non-technical customers.</li>
<li>Number of customers of the codebase: 1, 5 or a million: affects power over roadmap.</li>
<li>Tendering, and similar waterfall contracts.</li>
<li>Technical customers: might inspect source code.</li>
<li>Early stage start-up: collect data to get prepared for later</li>
</ul>
<p>Badly written contracts (from flying pigs to blank cheques.)</p>
<p>Conspiring with the customer to underestimate costs and schedule.</p>
<p>Customers would always rather squeeze out another comfort feature before signing off.</p>
<p>Psychological abuse by customer and self-help.</p>
<p>BATNA</p>
<p>Trust is the only currency.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="stochastic-implementation-times"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Stochastic implementation times</h2>
<p>Ticket implementation times are long tailed distributions.</p>
<p>Guarantees about small units of work are foolhardy.</p>
<p>Epics more predictable than individual tickets, if you do the sums right.</p>
<p>Even completed tickets aren’t 100% certain, as bugs may yet be found.</p>
<p>Real vs imaginary deadlines: customer must quantify the damage of lateness of specific goals to set risk aversity.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="developers"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Developers</h2>
<h3 data-number="2.3.1" id="constraints"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Constraints</h3>
<p>Will start the next ticket when the previous one is complete.</p>
<p>Devs can only rescue endangered deadlines by incurring tech debt.</p>
<p>Devs choose tickets that match their skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal knowledge monopolies are common.</li>
<li>Adding up story points assumes a clone army.</li>
<li>Velocity is not per team, rather, per-dev, or per-dev-in-a-given-module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritization melee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergencies</li>
<li>Deadlines</li>
<li>Blocking and blocked tickets</li>
<li>Procrastinated tech debt</li>
<li>Pick a small ticket cos sprint end is near (what???)</li>
</ul>
<p>Devs’ other duties</p>
<h3 data-number="2.3.2" id="psychology"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Psychology</h3>
<p>Devs are in short supply, and they know it.</p>
<p>More likely to be turnover’s limiting factor than customers.</p>
<p>Depressed by tech debt and angered by being forced to incur it.</p>
<p>Taught to overgeneralise.</p>
<p>Enjoy retros.</p>
<p>Reluctant to estimate in days, fearing accountability.</p>
<p>Sociable, but need uninterrupted time.</p>
<p>Might fail to fear complexity.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="tech-debt"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Tech debt</h2>
<p>It’s deadly.</p>
<p>It is literally a debt, so calculate the interest rate and tell the CFO.</p>
<p>Want to keep codebase alive until rendered obsolete by changes in market or tech.</p>
<h3 data-number="2.4.1" id="the-gory-details-of-codebase-collapse"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> The gory details of codebase collapse</h3>
<p>(% indicates measurable symptom)</p>
<ul>
<li>All productive work generates mess which costs money and time to clear up:
<ul>
<li>Every builder understands this, as does every restauranteur, every hairdresser, everybody.</li>
<li>Only software managers miss this because the mess is only visible to the devs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There’s regular deadline pressure %</li>
<li>Devs beg for time to tidy up and are refused due to deadline pressure.</li>
<li>Smart devs ignore the refusal, but they’re outnumbered and can’t keep pace.</li>
<li>The mess complicates future development so:
<ul>
<li>it multiplies exponentially,</li>
<li>coding is slow, %</li>
<li>speed of coding is less predictable. %</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Devs become despondent at the mess they have to deal with and dream of a better project.</li>
<li>They blame managament for refusing them the time to work to a standard they could be proud of.</li>
<li>They abandon ship, and especially if they’re vocal about the reasons, others follow. %</li>
<li>Newbies are hired but there aren’t enough old hands to teach them about the spaghetti.</li>
<li>A high proportion of new hires quit early. %</li>
<li>They reimplement functionality they don’t know is already there so:
<ul>
<li>Linecount expands faster than features. %</li>
<li>Bugs proliferate due to the redundancy.</li>
<li>Terror modules appear: those that nobody dares touch and that complicate life for interacting modules</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More time devoted to bug fixing than new features. %</li>
<li>More deadline pressure cos feature train not advancing.</li>
<li>Bug list can’t be shortened after many months or years. %</li>
<li>Toxic blame game breaks out.</li>

<p>Along that timeline, there’s a “technical watershed” after which there is no hope of rescuing the codebase, but before then, there’s a “political watershed” after which the decisions required to rescue it will not be made because they would be so expensive that denial is the more likely response.</p>

<p>Do what’s in your own interest. The customer is a means to an end.</p>
<p>Roadmap is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long term: problems people would like solved, no solutionizing.</li>
<li>Short term: tickets for devs.</li>
<li>Mid term: solutionizing phase: negotiation between customers and devs facilitated by PO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling long term product evolution.</li>
<li>Fending off ad-hoc customer requests.</li>
<li>Informing devs of long term requirements to support architecture decisions.</li>
<li>Staffing and capacity planning.</li>
<li>Not pitching for business you can’t deliver.</li>
<li>Flexing scope (luxury) rather than quality or schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Roadmap items should offer a range of luxury levels. Customer sees roadmap and is motivated to keep pace with it, which means they agree to reduce luxury level when things take longer than expected. Option of cutting quality or magically working faster is not entertained, although postponement of whole roadmap might be.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="pos"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> POs</h2>
<p>Roadmap is driven by people with domain and product knowledge.</p>
<p>Define POs as people with that knowledge.</p>
<p>Other duties requiring that knowledge (which POs will try to delegate in a later chapter):</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing finished stories</li>
<li>Receiving customer requests and saying:
<ul>
<li>We have that already</li>
<li>It’s on the roadmap</li>
<li>We’ll think about it</li>
<li>Not gonna do it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preparing training material</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Assume the roadmap is notionally ordered in all three terms. Devs will use that to make assumptions about what’s been done by the time the task of interest will be attempted.</p>
<p>Look for practical solutions that maximise customer satisfaction whilst minimising disruption of codebase. (Refactorings should consider entire roadmap.)</p>
<p>Involve all customers who might want the feature.</p>
<p>Involve testers who’ll ask about edge cases and force the spec to be expressed unambiguously.</p>

<h1 data-number="5" id="testers-as-assistant-pos"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Testers as assistant POs</h1>
<p>POs were defined as those with domain and product knowledge.</p>
<p>They are very busy with roadmap preparation. Can we relieve them of the “other duties” above?</p>
<p>Yes, using testers, but the POs must file testable tickets. That’s also good because:</p>
<ul>
<li>POs forced to think through the edge cases early</li>
<li>Devs’ estimates are better informed</li>
</ul>
<p>Testers grow into POs cos they’re learning domain and product knowledge.</p>

<h1 data-number="6" id="estimation-by-pms"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Estimation by PMs</h1>
<p>Good estimation is the precondition of all best practices:</p>

<li>Under constant deadline pressure, codebase collapse is inevitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>PM’s domain. POs not involved. PMs don’t need much domain or product knowledge, but they might find a statistics course useful.</p>
<p>There are no commitments. There are probabilities, which are more useful to everybody involved.</p>
<p>Weather forecast anecdote on the folly of digitizing probabilities.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="little-oracle"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Little Oracle</h2>
<p>Looks at a ticket in isolation (with hypothetical field value overrides) and returns mean and variance of probability distribution of implementation time.</p>
<p>Made by data mining past tickets and source control.</p>
<p>(Measuring implementation time of past tickets is not trivial, but we can start crude and refine later.)</p>
<p>Likely predictive fields (this is just a guess - only the stats can decide):</p>
<ul>
<li>Story points (one would hope)</li>
<li>Volatility: dev-assigned t-shirt size of variance: “beaten track” vs. “experimental” vs. “utter mystery”</li>
<li>Assignee: some are slower than others, maybe cos they’re more strategic or diligent</li>
<li>Zones (i.e. directories) of codebase: spaghetti modules</li>
<li>Familiarity of assignee in zones: mined as work done there by that dev in the recent past</li>
</ul>
<p>(Keep richness of model within Hoeffding’s inequality; 10 * coefficients &lt; training points.)</p>
<p>But how early can these fields be populated? In time for estimation purposes?</p>
<p>Scrum leaves assignee until the last minute, and that’s not helpful for estimation.</p>
<p>Little oracle can help teams plan by advising how long a ticket might take according to who attempts it.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.2" id="big-oracle"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Big Oracle</h2>
<p>Considers a set of tickets and a release date and returns the probability of all those tickets being completed by then.</p>
<p>Uses little oracle (which only returns durations), but needs to know start date for each ticket.</p>
<p>That’s the completion date of that dev’s previous ticket, so we must know the assignment of tickets to devs and their ordering, a.k.a. their “in-trays”.</p>
<p>Should know about holidays and equivalent interruptions like workshops.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.1" id="in-trays"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> In-trays</h3>
<p>Take an ordered backlog. Assign some tickets to some devs. Filter on an assignee, retaining order. That’s an in-tray.</p>
<p>“Tetris” assignment method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull a ticket from the ordered backlog.</li>
<li>Assign it to whoever will finish it first considering:
<ul>
<li>how much work they already have in their in-tray,</li>
<li>how long the little oracle thinks that ticket will take them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeat until all in-trays cover the timescale of interest for estimation.</li>
</ul>
<p>(That makes no attempt to disseminate monopolised code knowledge, but see the chapter on skills management.)</p>
<p>If teams use some defined method like the above, it can be simulated or automated. Human overrides would improve the planning prognosis, so planning based on the simulation gives a valid worst case.</p>
<p>Sequential dependencies between tickets can be dealt with by reordering the backlog to minimise the chance of overlap. The big oracle will estimate that chance.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.2.2" id="release-planner"><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Release Planner</h3>
<p>By a given release date, a PM may hope that each dev gets through a prefix of their in-tray.</p>
<p>To get the probability of success:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean implementation time of the prefix is the sum of the means of the tickets in that prefix.
<ul>
<li>(The truth of this is a desideratum for the method of measuring implementation time.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Similarly add the variances.</li>
<li>Start from when work started on the dev’s current ticket.</li>
<li>Use normal distribution (that error is inconsequential) with that mean and variance to read off the probability of completion before the release date.</li>
<li>Treat different devs as independent and multiply the probabilities.
<ul>
<li>(It’s assumed that devs minimised the probability of overlapping sequential dependencies when planning, otherwise an advanced big oracle can model that probability.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>PM can mark a ticket as “promised”, which discourages teams from rearranging in-trays to the detriment of such a ticket.</p>
<p>Won’t-do closure is the same as completion for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Similar tool for fixed-scope, variable-date releases.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="the-world-changes"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> The World Changes</h2>
<p>… when the PM shares the release planner with the customer and invites them to choose their own risks. (The ordering has already been agreed via POs)</p>
<p>The customer would initially choose too many tickets but notice the probability plummet. Now, instead of haggling oppositionally, the PM and customer are working together against the maths of life. The brutal behaviour of probabilities is made plain to both, and past failures seem more understandable. The customer is forced to decide which tickets are truly urgent and which are gold plating.</p>
<p>If forced to commit to a deadline, mouth the words, but state the probabilities as well. Expose changes of probability early. Gradually, they should learn that the probabilities are more helpful to them than doubtful commitments.</p>

<p>Start with a “parent” field in tickets which identifies the ticket that motivated this one.</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="development"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Development</h1>
<p>Must retain devs (might take several years to ramp up newbies.)</p>
<p>Devs have lots to do besides chasing deadlines:</p>

<li>Architecture planning</li>
<li>Bug triage and fix</li>
<li>Devops, build train</li>
<li>Customer support</li>
<li>Data curation?</li>
<li>Tech debt reduction, unit testing</li>

<h2 data-number="7.2" id="rituals"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Rituals</h2>
<p>Sprints are both harmful and futile, but retros are popular.</p>
<p>No afternoon meetings for devs - coding only. Rare exceptions tolerated.</p>
<p>PO time belongs to devs in the morning so they must meet customers and each other in afternoons.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.1" id="refinement"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Refinement</h3>
<p>PO’s meet teams for regular refinement meetings which alternate with PO-customer meetings. Could have a daily slot of up to 60 minutes after standup.</p>
<p>Refinement demand is patchy (high when planning a big new feature) so that 60 minutes might need to be adjusted. If afternoons are to be used for workshops, tell the estimation machine about the resulting standstill using tickets or holidays.</p>
<p>Refined tickets have story points, volatility and code zone set. Or whatever the current estimation algorithm calls for.</p>
<p>Assignment doesn’t need to be set this early cos the estimation machine can simulate tetris.</p>
<p>Instead of story points, this process would be equally happy with devs estimating in days. Either way it’ll be calibrated. But devs feel less exposed using story points.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.2" id="assignment"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Assignment</h3>
<p>Estimation requires per-dev in-trays, not scrumboard or kanban.</p>
<p>Teams have regular meetings to populate in-trays. The earliest non-closed ticket in an in-tray is implicitly in progress. Park tickets by re-ordering.</p>

<p>Teams complain to POs when refined backlog in danger of running dry, or, PO directly responsible.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.3" id="updating-tickets"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> Updating tickets</h3>
<p>In-trays (i.e. assignee and ordering) may be rearranged by teams with impunity if it wouldn’t delay estimation of a ticket marked as promised. If it would, they still can, and a PM will be alerted.</p>
<p>Story points, volatility and code zone should be updated by devs whenever new, relevant information comes to light. The ticket tracker must remember the full history of all fields for consumption by the estimation machine.</p>
<p>There could also be a percentage progress field, but we shouldn’t ask devs to update it every day, rather, it’ll count down automatically and the assignee may adjust it if it looks wrong.</p>
<p>PMs will be alerted if a deadline is endangered by any change (perhaps of a ticket before the promised one in the same in-tray.)</p>
<p>The rest of the time, the estimation machine can infer progress.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.4" id="stand-ups"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.4</span> Stand-ups</h3>
<p>Morning stand-ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to predict how long a discussion will ramble for, so hard to decide to break-out</li>
<li>So agenda should be:
<ol type="1">
<li>Anybody blocked?</li>
<li>Anybody know something that affects what somebody else should be doing? (Adjourn after this if over 30 minutes.)</li>
<li>Anything to demo to PO? (Even with sprints, these should be ASAP upon completion.)</li>
<li>Any gossip?</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>If somebody wants a breakout meeting that requires just a subset of a team, the standup is the least appropriate context in which to arrange it. They can arrange a meeting in the diary or chat system.</p>
<p>PMs may turn up to standups to ask for estimate updates on tickets.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.2.5" id="demos"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.5</span> Demos</h3>

<li>Push or pull, recovery</li>
<li>Eliminate redundancy</li>
<li>Make sure everybody can draw the data model blindfold</li>

<p>Customers are rarely prepared to do scrum. It can only happen under time and materials billing, which implies that the customer owns the codebase, in which case, there’s no customer relationship to speak of other than some monthly timesheets. These are the circumstances under which the supplier needs no process.</p>
<p>Fixed price work needs a waterfall spec and timescale. Result is internal “phony scrum.”</p>
<h3 data-number="11.1.2" id="conflict-of-interest"><span class="header-section-number">11.1.2</span> Conflict of interest</h3>

<h3 data-number="11.3.1" id="the-sprint-commitment"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.1</span> The Sprint Commitment</h3>
<p>Digitising probabilities is self-deception. Don’t ignore variance</p>
<p>Devs shouldn’t be motivated to cut corners.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.2" id="probability-of-hitting-sprint-goal"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.2</span> Probability of hitting sprint goal</h3>
<p>Managers bet the farm on doing so, but the odds are well below 50%. If loaded to average velocity and in equilibrium then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Velocity is an average, so the probability of scoring fewer points equals that of scoring more.</li>
<li>If you score less, you didn’t hit the sprint goal.</li>
<li>If you score more, perhaps those were different tickets from the promised ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>If 10 tickets in a sprint each independently have P=90% (no ticket has more), then the sprint goal is at 35%. (In fact they can only be independent if there are 10 devs. The point is that people intuitively approximate 90% to 100% and accumulate this huge error over a set of tickets.)</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.3" id="pointing-without-technical-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.3</span> Pointing without technical analysis</h3>
<p>Edge cases and architectural difficulties not anticipated</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.4" id="dancing-to-the-gong"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.4</span> Dancing to the gong</h3>
<p>No power in the world can make tickets start and end in sync.</p>
<p>But devs can fake it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close the ticket and file another for the unhandled edge cases</li>
<li>Neglect the unit tests</li>
<li>Waste time after completing tickets to hold velocity down.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="11.3.5" id="planned-vs.-surprise-points"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.5</span> Planned vs. surprise points</h3>
<p>Surprise points that arise after planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spun off from prematurely closed tickets</li>
<li>Caused when stumbling over tech debt</li>
<li>Filed by devs upon finding bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>Velocity credits both planned and surprise points, but planners load sprints with planned points up to the velocity, only to see sprints blown by surprise points.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.6" id="discards-true-start-and-finish-times"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.6</span> Discards true start and finish times</h3>
<p>… so useless for mining durations.</p>
<p>Accident of ticket finishing just before or just after sprint end causes huge noise in velocity.</p>
<p>That noise means you must wait several sprints to deduce a systematic change with statistical significance.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.7" id="degradation-of-historical-data"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.7</span> Degradation of historical data</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implementation time records distorted by incentive to fake sprint success.</li>

<p>Russian roulette is equally dangerous however often you count the score.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.10" id="clone-army-assumption"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.10</span>Specialisation ignored under clone-army assumption</h3>
<p>Happy to load sprint entirely with tickets only one dev can do</p>
<p>Velocity is just per-team although teams maximise their ability gradient (every team needs a top gun and must share newbie load.)</p>
<p>To believe that lucky and unlucky tickets balance out in a sprint, you have to believe that a lucky dev can add labour to an unlucky ticket without friction, which is to deny that a dev is more expert than others at the very ticket they have in progress.</p>
<h3 data-number="11.3.11" id="story-points-as-unit-of-time"><span class="header-section-number">11.3.11</span> Story points as unit of time</h3>
<p>They claim story points are about complexity rather than time, but they use it like time anyway when loading sprints.</p>
<p>Days in terms of points is not a y=mx+0 function.</p>

<ul>
<li>People have to put fires out.</li>
<li>A ticket in progress might need another team to flip a switch (before 1-2 sprints pass.)</li>
<li>Tickets get blocked and go on hold.</li>
<li>Tech debt is uncovered.</li>
<li>Ideas change.</li>
<li>Nightclub rules is just bureaucratic life-support for a failed tracking method.</li>

<p>This is just for scrum’s sake but it clouds the relationship between tickets and deliverables.</p>

<p>You can’t tell how much longer a discussion will go on for and it’s hard to decide to exclude people from a discussion. So go in order of urgency, not people.</p>

<p>Doubles down on worst mistakes of scrum:</p>

<li>Bigger gong</li>
<li>Customer assumed pliable</li>
<li>Wild assumptions about nature of project, esp. size of deliverable features</li>
<li>Nobody touch the fire extinguisher</li>
</ul>
<p>Favours flexing scope over schedule or quality, but fails to create the conditions that allow this, namely a prepared range of luxury levels.</p>
